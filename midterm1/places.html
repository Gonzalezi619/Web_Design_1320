       <h1>Cities in West Virginia</h1> 
       <h3>Fayeteville</h3>
       <div style="text-align: left"><img src="images/fayetteville.jpg" alt="fayetteville"></div>
       <p>Fayeteville is one of the coolest small cities in America. It won one of the coolest in 2017. You can raft, gaze at the new river gorge and the new river gorge bridge. Rock climb, camp, and moutain bike too. If you love the outdoors then this is the place for you.</P>
        <p>The river isn't the only thing flowing, the city itself is home to some brewers and some of the best food in the state.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Elkins/Davis Area</h3>
        <div style="text-align: right"><img src="images/blackwaterfalls.jpg" alt="blackwater"></div>
        <p>Talk about breath-taking scenery. If you want to see some beautiful mountains or see some waterfalls this is the area.</p>
        <p>Home to Seneca Rocks and Blackwater Falls. It is going to be hard to find a place on the east coast prettier then this region. Especially in the fall</p>
        <p>After, your done lost in the woods pop down to davis for some local food and you guessed it... more local breweries. I hope you like friendly folk because that's what you'll find espeically if you hang out around the Purple Fiddle.</p>
