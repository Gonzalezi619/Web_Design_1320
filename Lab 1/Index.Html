        <h1>Moving to a New City</h1>
        <p>I am originally from New Jersey. I lived in New Jersey for 18 years, I was located about 45 minutes from New York City.I attended West Virginia University after completing highschool.I completed my degree in four years and fell in love with the state. I lived in West Virgnina for another year after completion. I find myself here in Chattanooga, because I wanted something new and wanted to experience a city that had a good balance of "city" life and the outdoors. I have come to enjoy my time here and can't wait to see what else this city has in store.</p>
